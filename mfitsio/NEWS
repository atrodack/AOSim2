--------- 1.2.4 ---------
* Due to changes to gcc to make it more compliant with the standard,
mfitsio did not compile. I have tweaked the code so that it is more
compliant with the standard.

--------- 1.2.3 ---------
* Fixed a minor typographical error in version 1.2.2 involving a literal 
string spanning multiple lines. Apparently, older versions of gcc did not 
return an error when this occurred. Based on recent reports from people 
using new, more standards-compliant compilers, I was able to detect the 
error. No other updates are present in this release.

--------- 1.2.2 ---------
* Thanks to Shukur Kholikov (kholikov@noao.edu) for noticing that files 
opened in fits_read_info (C function) were not closed. After enough 
successive calls to fits_read_header or fits_read, the open file 
descriptor limit would have been reached. This problem is fixed.

--------- 1.2.1 ---------
* Files in fits_read, fits_read_image, and fits_read_header were being 
opened in READ_WRITE mode. Fixed this so that read-only files could be 
opened.

--------- 1.2 -----------
* Removed all use of the fits_transpose_all function.

* FITS reading/writing interface routines are now more dynamic.

* Fixed some kludges in fits_read_image_impl. In particular, double
arrays are not created as an intermediate step prior to returning
a FITS array to the MATLAB environment. As a result significantly less
processing time and memory is used.

* Fixed bug in fits_write_image_impl. Bug was caused by improperly
casting non-double values to double causing an overflow when the
BITPIX is not -64.

* Added more information about data type conversion to the README file.
--------- 1.1 -----------
* Fixed memory bug caused when reading a FITS file directly after writing
to the same file.

* Finished implementing the fits_read_subset and fits_write_subset
functions. This is particularly useful for reading hyperspectral
images.

--------- 1.0 -----------
This is the first version of MFITSIO. MFITSIO provides a MATLAB
interface to the cfitsio library available from NASA. For a complete
description of MFITSIO as well as its features, consult the README
file. The primary purpose of this file is to report changes and
additions in each version.
